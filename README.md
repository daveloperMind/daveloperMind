###

<p align="left">While my main language is Java right now, I am currently working to switching that over to C++ (If you have any tips or advice, my Linkedin is in my bio)</p>

###

<p align="left">I am working on getting my associates degree before transferring to a University of California for my bachelors.</p>

###

<p align="left">I am also intermediate at Linux, specifically debian based distros and I am currently learning Arch Linux.</p>

###

<p align="left">I have a passion for open-source and I hope that one day I can be a contributor to Arch.</p>
